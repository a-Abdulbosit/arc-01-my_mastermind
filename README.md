The Mastermind Game is a command-line implementation of the classic code-breaking game. In this game, one player creates a secret code, and the other player tries to guess it within a limited number of attempts. The game provides feedback on the correctness of the guessed code, indicating the number of well-placed and miss-placed pieces.

Compilation and Execution

To compile and run the Mastermind Game on your local machine, follow these steps:

Compile the code using the Makefile by running the following command: "make"

This command will use the provided Makefile to compile the source code and create an executable file named my_mastermind.

Run the game by executing the compiled binary: "./my_mastermind"

The game will display a welcome message and prompt you to enter a valid guess for the secret code.

Enter a 4-digit number as your guess, with each digit ranging from 0 to 8. Press Enter to submit your guess.

The game will provide feedback on the correctness of your guess, indicating the number of well-placed and miss-placed pieces.

Continue guessing until you either guess the correct code or run out of attempts.
